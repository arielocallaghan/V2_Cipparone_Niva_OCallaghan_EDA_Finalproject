## Summary

<This repository was created for an Environmental Data Analytics Class at Duke University Nicholas School of the Environment. This repository contains information on Pennsylvania coal production, Census, water quality, and community health rankings. This project was started in November 2022 and will be completed by December 12, 2022. The goal of this analysis is to understand the impact coal production has on community health indications. A multivariate regression will be utilized as the primary form of analysis.>

## Database Information

<Coal Production data: Raw data was collected from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) coal production tab. Individual data sets per year were download and wrangled to only show coal production numbers in Pennsylvania. The total data was then aggregated for further analysis. This data was first accessed on XXXX

Census Data: The second primary data set utilized is the American Community Survey (ACS) data set and is part of the U.S. Census. The ACS provides survey information on a yearly basis about our nation and its people. This data was accessed on XXX.

Community Heath data: This data was collected and downloaded from County Health Rankings and Roadmaps. Data was download for Pennsylvania from 2010-2020. This data was accessed on November 28, 2022.

## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions 

<Folders:
Raw Data: This is the data imported as a .csv with out any wrangling or manipulation. All raw data sets utilized in analysis for this project are located here. 

Processed Data: This folder contains data that has been wrangled to include the information needed for further analysis. Additionally it contains combined data sets of individual years of each database download combined into once csv file. The combine.csv file is a combination of all the individual data sets after they have been wrangled into one complete file. This file contains all the information needed for analysis conducted during this project. 

Data Wrangled: This folder contains the rmd files utilized to wrangle and manipulate the individual data sets. Additionally it contains code for creating visualizations, summary statistics and plots.

Data Analysis: This folder contains rmd files used to analyze our complete data set.

Report: This folder contains the rmd file of our report that was written and prepared for the class project. Additionally it contains some reference documents on the project requirements and some rmd cheat sheets for quick reference.
