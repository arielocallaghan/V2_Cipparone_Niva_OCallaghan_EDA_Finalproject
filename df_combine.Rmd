#INFO FROM DATA WRANGLING CLASS LESSON
#In many cases, we will want to combine datasets into one dataset. If all column names match, the data frames can be combined with the `rbind` function. If some column names match and some column names don't match, we can combine the data frames using a "join" function according to common conditions that exist in the matching columns. We will demonstrate this with the NTL-LTER physical and nutrient datasets, where we have specific instances when physical and nutrient data were collected on the same date, at the same lake, and at the same depth. 

#In dplyr, there are several types of join functions: 

#* `inner_join`: return rows in x where there are matching values in y, and all columns in x and y (mutating join).
#* `semi_join`: return all rows from x where there are matching values in  y, keeping just columns from x (filtering join).
#* `left_join`: return all rows from x, and all columns from x and y (mutating join).
#* `anti_join`: return all rows from x where there are *not* matching values in y, keeping just columns from x (filtering join).
#* `full_join`: return all rows and all columns from x and y. Returns NA for missing values (mutating join).

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
