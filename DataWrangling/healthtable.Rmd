## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r summary table}

healthdf.table<- healthdf %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_Health_Outcome_rank = mean(Health.Outcomes.Rank),
    min_health_outcome_rank = min(mean_Health_Outcome_rank),
    max_Health_Outcome_rank = max(Health.Outcomes.Rank),
    sd_Health_Outcome_rank = sd(Health.Outcomes.Rank))

#kable(healthdf.table,caption = "Health Indicators Outcomes Summary Table") 

healthdf.table.Z<- healthdf %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_Health_Outcome_Zscore = mean(Health.Outcomes.Z.Score),
    min_health_outcome_Zscore = min(mean_Health_Outcome_Zscore),
    max_Health_Outcome_Zscore = max(Health.Outcomes.Z.Score),
    sd_Health_Outcome_zscore = sd(Health.Outcomes.Z.Score))


#kable(healthdf.table.Z, caption = "Health Indicators Z Score Summary Table ")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r create.summary.table,}
kable(x = healthdf.table, 
      format = "html",
      col.names = c("Year","Mean Rank","Min Rank","Max Rank","SD Rank"),
      caption = "Health Indicators Outcomes Summary Table")%>%
  kable_styling()

#%>%kable_classic()
# echo=FALSE
kable(x = healthdf.table.Z, 
      format = "html",
      col.names = c("Year", "Mean Z", "Min Z", "Max Z", "SD Z"),
      caption = "Health Indicators Z Score Summary Table")%>%
    kable_styling()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
